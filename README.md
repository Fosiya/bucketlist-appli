# Bucketlist App

This is the final assignment for the Webbutvecklare Full Stack open source program. The task is to make a functional bucketlist application where users can register, log in, edit and remove bucketlists. Within the bucketlists users can add, edit and delete goals, and of course mark them as complete.

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

It will run both the server and client simultaneously, the client will open on its own but if it doesn't, you can go to <http://localhost:3000/>. Server runs on port 5050.

## Run client and server separately
In the terminal, you can run:

### `cd server/src && node server.js`
To start the server.

### `cd client && npm run start`
To start the client, make sure you start up the server before you do so.
